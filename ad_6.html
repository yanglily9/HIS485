            <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 9px; "><span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis: </span>These two might be marriage advertisements or commercial advertisements; it is difficult to determine if it was one or the other. It is odd that Miss Gu mentioned that she has contraception and the university student wanted a nude picture from the guy and she will bring it to court if he breaches the initial registration. Nonetheless, both advertisements demonstrated the objectification of women and overemphasis of her physical appearance.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 9px; ">These advertisement emulated the format of a marriage advertisement and expressed what a woman is looking for in a husband. The image of women was commoditized because of its commercial publication and emphasis on appearance, sophistication and affluent background. Simplified to sound like a sales pitch for a product, a majority of the advertisement echoed the ideal paradigm of a women, placing “Miss Gu Wangxia” and the “University student” on a pedestal according to their outward packaging and feature equivalents of a product: appearance and its attributes. Stating that Miss Gu Wangxia “is from a decent and wealthy family. She is modern with a beautiful face, prettier than any beauty model. She has clean skin with no pimples or dark spot on her face. Her skin is silky and beautiful eyes,”[2] and the University student is lady-like with makeup, hair perm and heels and that she received over five to six hundred love letters, it reflected that their Chinese-ideal, physical facial features were the main points for the opening of an advertisement to attract male attention. In “Miss Gu Wangxia”, with a feature on her body, education, as well as her sophisticated ability to understand men [2], these attributes spoke about the woman as if she were nothing more than a comfort product. By not adding depth and character to these women, it evidently portrayed the social status and depiction of a woman that the public understood her to be: as a two dimensional, shallow product that wasn’t valued beyond her ability to provide for men.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 9px; ">Beyond being a paradigm of what the Chinese society desired an ideal wife to have, it did not give women any status beyond a beautiful face, or a provider of comfort, both sexual and mental, as a spouse. By stating that Miss Wangxia “understands the psychology of men, understandings how to provide mental comfort for men”[2], she was promoted as a pawn that catered towards the whims and needs of the dominant gender of the past. With her education and intelligence, she was able to represent and serve the class of well-off men. In such an implicit community, there was also explicit desires that women seemed to have to carry out. Through the phrase “She also has contraception” [2], this can be inferred as the lady being able to provide frequent sexual comfort to men as well. It is evident that in a marriage advertisement, the woman was literally sold off as a body where the potential patriarch would be able to take what he needed, as if she was there just to serve. Whether this was an actual marriage advertisement or a commercial advertisement, it still demonstrated that the wife was merely there to support the husband, while many of the characteristics in the females were vastly sexualized and physical. The physical attributes and ability to cater to men was what a wife was valued to have, as was the general consensus that could even be published in the papers without question. Regardless of the type of advertisement, the overemphasis on the portrayal of physical appearance demonstrated that both women were still objectified as a commodity to attract men’s attention. Even if this was a marriage advertisement, the sexualization in their initial paragraph demonstrated the need to appear to be attractive in order to be desired.
